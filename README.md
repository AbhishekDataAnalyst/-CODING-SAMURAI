Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Listings  Project Description: In this project, you will perform basic data analysis on a dataset of  Airbnb listings. EDA is a fundamental step in data science that involves exploring and  understanding the data before diving into more complex analysis or modeling.

Solution

Data Collection: Find a dataset of Airbnb listings in a city of your choice. You can often 
find such datasets on websites like Kaggle, Inside Airbnb, or by using Airbnb's official 
API (if available).

Data Exploration: Load and examine the dataset to get a sense of its structure. Look at 
the first few rows, data types, and basic statistics.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and clean the data. This may involve filling 
missing values, removing duplicates, or correcting data inconsistencies.

Basic Statistics: Calculate and visualize basic statistics like the average price of listings, 
the distribution of property types (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.), and the distribution of 
neighbourhoods.

Visualization: Create visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to explore 
relationships and trends in the data. For example, you can plot price distributions, room 
type preferences, or the number of listings by neighbourhood.
